# Chimp CLI
This is only a proving ground for a different project in the works. 

Here, I plan to try things out with Rust and Clap to get a better understanding of the concepts in both.

Once I've figured things out, I can implement them in the _actual_ project (that doesn't exist yet).

I expect this to change drastically with no real rhyme or reason.
